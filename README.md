If you want to use this as a reference
first things first do the following

1. You should have PHP installed on your computer
2. You should have composer installed on your computer
3. open your xampp and create a database 'api_sanctum' or you can change this whatever you want
4. before running rename the '.env.example' to '.env' otherwise it will not work because it won't be abale to locate the .env file
5. go to config/sanctum.php and do your preferred setting or you can leave it as it is
